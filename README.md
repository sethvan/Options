My first C Project, a console app

I did this in mid December 2020 after stuying C for 2 months. The math used is arbitrary but gives a general 
idea of how you subcosciously are assessing your options concerning any given thing. What I am told is that 
I should have made the main much cleaner and modularized the project more as a whole. I God-willingly will 
eventually get around to that.
